# film_map
This module is designed for creating html page that contains map.

With this module, you can find places nearby, where films were filmed in specific year.

# Example
!Disclaimer! Requests for getting coordinates take a lot of time so
program might work for a long time. It works rather fast with distant years like 1911.

Running main.py in terminal with function main_func() (example_screenshots/Terminal_exmpl.png)

After running the program we get generated the html page "film_map.html" (example_screenshots/map_example.png)
